# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Dependencies Used

- React bootstrap
- React router
- React router bootstrap
- Font Awesome

## Details

Since the features are less important that quailty code, attention was paid to the naming of component and component styles. That being said, you would get a waring when the app is run. That is just a bootstrap open issue that throws a warning with **eslint**. It is not a problem. It has already been fixed in bootstrap v5.2.0 but i opted not to use that since it is only a beta release.\
The routing works perfectly too.\
In the prototype file given, most of the assets included cannot be exported(set by the designer) so you would notice some inconsistencies like in the logo and background image.

## Things to improve

- There was no mobile screens provided so the responsiveness can be improved upon.
- Add the missing assets to improve the overall look and feel of the site.
- Implement a function to make the dummy countdown function.

## Note

Kindly note that i was pressed for time so i skipped the blog page altogether even though i set up a route for it. I also skipped the styling of the about page which i would continue to push updates to after i have submitted this repo link so i do not miss the deadline.

Thanks!
